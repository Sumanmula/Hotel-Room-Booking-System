# INTRODUCTION
This Simple Hotel Management System is a Java-based project designed using Object-Oriented Principles and Low-Level Design (LLD). It manages core hotel operations like guest registration with OTP verification, room management (add/update), and reservation handling with room availability checks. Rooms are categorized by type (Single, Double, Deluxe), each with a specific capacity and pricing. The system ensures correct room allocation based on guest needs and prevents double-booking by tracking availability. It simulates a complete hotel workflow—from adding rooms and guests to confirming bookings—all with clean and maintainable code architecture.

# OBJECTIVE
The objectives of the Hotel Management System are to simplify the day-to-day operations of a hotel and ensure smooth handling of guest services and room reservations.
The project contains:

  1. Registering guests with OTP-based verification to ensure secure check-ins.
  2. Maintaining a proper list of all rooms along with their types, prices, and availability status.
  3. Allowing room booking based on availability and guest requirements, including group size and stay duration.
  4. Managing reservations efficiently by preventing double-booking and keeping track of all bookings made.
  5. Providing a clear and structured way to update room details and track guest information.
